        <p>I'll keep it short and sweet — Family. Religion. Friendship. These are the three demons you must slay if
            you wish to succeed in business. Inflammable means flammable? What a country. Kids, you tried your best
            and you failed miserably. The lesson is, never try.</p>
        <p>Oh, I'm in no condition to drive. Wait a minute. <strong> I don't have to listen to myself.</strong> <em>
                I'm drunk.</em> Your guilty consciences may make you vote Democratic, but secretly you all yearn for
            a Republican president to lower taxes, brutalize criminals, and rule you like a king!</p>
        <h2>Hi. I'm Troy McClure. You may remember me from such self-help tapes as "Smoke Yourself Thin" and "Get
            Some Confidence, Stupid!"</h2>

        <p>Marge, just about everything's a sin. Y'ever sat down and read this thing? Technically we're not supposed
            to go to the bathroom. I prefer a vehicle that doesn't hurt Mother Earth. It's a go-cart, powered by my
            own sense of self-satisfaction.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Don't kid yourself, Jimmy. If a cow ever got the chance, he'd eat you and everyone you care about!
            </li>
            <li>When will I learn? The answers to life's problems aren't at the bottom of a bottle, they're on TV!
            </li>
            <li>I can't go to juvie. They use guys like me as currency.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Attempted murder? Now honestly, what is that? Do they give a Nobel Prize for attempted chemistry?</h3>
        <p>Marge, it takes two to lie. One to lie and one to listen. Our differences are only skin deep, but our
            sames go down to the bone. Donuts. Is there anything they can't do? I'm allergic to bee stings. They
            cause me to, uh, die.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>When will I learn? The answers to life's problems aren't at the bottom of a bottle, they're on TV!
            </li>
            <li>Thank you, steal again.</li>
            <li>Weaseling out of things is important to learn. It's what separates us from the animals…except the
                weasel.</li>
        </ul>
        <a href="#">Juste un lien de test</a>
        <p>Oh, everything looks bad if you remember it. I was saying "Boo-urns." I've had it with this school,
            Skinner. Low test scores, class after class of ugly, ugly children… Save me, Jeebus. Kids, kids. I'm not
            going to die. That only happens to bad people.</p>
        <p>Lisa, vampires are make-believe, like elves, gremlins, and Eskimos. They only come out in the night. Or
            in this case, the day. I'm a Spalding Gray in a Rick Dees world. Stan Lee never left. I'm afraid his
            mind is no longer in mint condition.</p>
        <p>Brace yourselves gentlemen. According to the gas chromatograph, the secret ingredient is… Love!? Who's
            been screwing with this thing? Marge, it takes two to lie. One to lie and one to listen. Last night's
            "Itchy and Scratchy Show" was, without a doubt, the worst episode *ever.* Rest assured, I was on the
            Internet within minutes, registering my disgust throughout the world.</p>
        <p>D'oh. And now, in the spirit of the season: start shopping. And for every dollar of Krusty merchandise
            you buy, I will be nice to a sick kid. For legal purposes, sick kids may include hookers with a cold.
        </p>
        <p>You don't like your job, you don't strike. You go in every day and do it really half-assed. That's the
            American way. Weaseling out of things is important to learn. It's what separates us from the
            animals…except the weasel.</p>
        <p>Inflammable means flammable? What a country. "Thank the Lord"? That sounded like a prayer. A prayer in a
            public school. God has no place within these walls, just like facts don't have a place within an
            organized religion.</p>
        <p>Save me, Jeebus. I didn't get rich by signing checks. Marge, just about everything's a sin. Y'ever sat
            down and read this thing? Technically we're not supposed to go to the bathroom. I like my beer cold, my
            TV loud and my homosexuals flaming.</p>
        <p>Ahoy hoy? Mrs. Krabappel and Principal Skinner were in the closet making babies and I saw one of the
            babies and then the baby looked at me. Look out, Itchy! He's Irish! That's why I love elementary school,
            Edna. The children believe anything you tell them.</p>
        <p>We started out like Romeo and Juliet, but it ended up in tragedy. Lisa, vampires are make-believe, like
            elves, gremlins, and Eskimos. I like my beer cold, my TV loud and my homosexuals flaming. …And the
            fluffy kitten played with that ball of string all through the night. On a lighter note, a Kwik-E-Mart
            clerk was brutally murdered last night.</p>
        <p>I didn't get rich by signing checks. Whoa, slow down there, maestro. There's a *New* Mexico? Well, he's
            kind of had it in for me ever since I accidentally ran over his dog. Actually, replace "accidentally"
            with "repeatedly" and replace "dog" with "son."</p>
